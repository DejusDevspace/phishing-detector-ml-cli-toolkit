## Data and Data Collection

### Dataset Source

- Look for CSV files in the project `datasets/` folder
- The dataset contains examples of both legitimate URLs and phishing URLs
- Each URL is labeled as either safe (0) or phishing (1)

### Dataset Size

- Count the total number of rows in the main dataset file or check the `data_exploration.ipynb` file
- Note how many examples are legitimate vs. phishing

### Data Types

- **Binary Classification Problem**: The system predicts one of two outcomes (legitimate or phishing)
- **URL Features**: Features extracted from URLs for the dataset creation
- **Labels**: 0 = legitimate website, 1 = phishing website

### Data Quality

- Check if the dataset is balanced (roughly equal legitimate and phishing examples)
- Look for any data cleaning steps performed (`data_exploration.ipynb` file)
- Note any preprocessing done to prepare URLs for analysis

## Feature Engineering Process

### Feature Extraction

- **28 different characteristics** were extracted from each URL
- Each URL gets converted into 28 numerical values that the computer can analyze
- This process transforms text (URLs) into numbers for machine learning

### Feature Categories

#### URL Structure Features

- `url_length`: How long the entire web address is
- `number_of_dots_in_url`: Count of periods in the URL
- `number_of_digits_in_url`: Count of numbers in the URL
- `number_of_special_char_in_url`: Count of symbols like @, #, %, etc.
- `number_of_slash_in_url`: Count of forward slashes
- `number_of_hyphens_in_url`: Count of dash symbols

#### Domain Features

- `domain_length`: Length of the main website name
- `number_of_dots_in_domain`: Periods in the domain name
- `number_of_digits_in_domain`: Numbers in the domain name
- `having_digits_in_domain`: Whether the domain contains any numbers (yes/no)
- `number_of_hyphens_in_domain`: Dashes in the domain name

#### Subdomain Features

- `number_of_subdomains`: Count of subdomain parts
- `average_subdomain_length`: Average length of subdomain sections
- `having_digits_in_subdomain`: Whether subdomains contain numbers

#### Statistical Features

- `entropy_of_url`: Measure of randomness in the entire URL
- `entropy_of_domain`: Measure of randomness in the domain name
- Higher entropy = more random/suspicious patterns

### Feature Importance Rankings

The system identified which characteristics are most useful for detecting phishing:

1. **URL Length** (14.60% importance) - Most important feature
2. **Average Subdomain Length** (12.05% importance)
3. **Domain Entropy** (9.84% importance) - Randomness in domain
4. **URL Entropy** (9.66% importance) - Overall randomness
5. **Domain Length** (9.10% importance)

**Why these features matter:**

- Phishing URLs are often unusually long to hide malicious content
- Legitimate websites have predictable subdomain patterns
- Random character sequences suggest automatically generated phishing URLs

## Machine Learning Methodology

### Algorithm Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees

### Why Random Forest Was Chosen

- **Good with multiple features**: Handles all 28 characteristics effectively
- **Feature importance analysis**: Shows which URL characteristics matter most
- **Robust performance**: Less likely to overfit to training data
- **Interpretable results**: Can explain why decisions were made

### Training Process

1. **Split the data**: Part for training, part for testing
2. **Feed examples**: Show the algorithm thousands of labeled URLs
3. **Pattern learning**: Algorithm identifies what makes URLs phishing vs. legitimate
4. **Validation**: Test on unseen URLs to measure accuracy

### Feature Selection

- Used Random Forest's built-in feature importance scoring
- Identified the most predictive characteristics
- Focused on features that best distinguish phishing from legitimate URLs

## System Architecture

### Data Processing Module

- **Input validation**: Checks if the URL format is valid
- **Text cleaning**: Removes unnecessary characters or formatting
- **Standardization**: Ensures consistent URL format for analysis

### Feature Extraction Engine

- **Automated calculation**: Computes all 28 features from any input URL
- **Real-time processing**: Works instantly when given a new URL
- **Consistent measurement**: Same calculations applied to all URLs

### Machine Learning Model

- **Trained classifier**: The Random Forest model that learned from examples
- **Prediction engine**: Takes the 28 features and outputs a decision
- **Confidence scoring**: Provides probability estimates for predictions

### CLI Tool (Command Line Interface)

- **User interaction**: Allows users to input URLs for checking
- **Real-time analysis**: Processes URLs immediately
- **Result display**: Shows whether URL is likely phishing or legitimate

### Prediction System

- **Integration**: Combines all components into one workflow
- **End-to-end process**: From URL input to final classification
- **Output formatting**: Presents results in user-friendly format

## Performance Evaluation Metrics

### Classification Metrics

Look for these measurements in the `modeling.ipynb` file:

#### Accuracy

- **Definition**: Percentage of correct predictions overall
- **Calculation**: (Correct predictions) / (Total predictions)
- **Interpretation**: Higher is better (0-100%)

#### Precision

- **Definition**: Of URLs predicted as phishing, how many actually were phishing
- **Why important**: Measures false alarm rate
- **Formula**: True Phishing / (True Phishing + False Alarms)

#### Recall (Sensitivity)

- **Definition**: Of actual phishing URLs, how many were correctly identified
- **Why important**: Measures missed phishing attacks
- **Formula**: True Phishing / (True Phishing + Missed Phishing)

#### F1-Score

- **Definition**: Balance between precision and recall
- **Why important**: Single metric combining both aspects
- **Range**: 0 to 1, where 1 is perfect

### Confusion Matrix

A table showing:

- **True Positives**: Phishing URLs correctly identified
- **True Negatives**: Legitimate URLs correctly identified
- **False Positives**: Legitimate URLs incorrectly flagged as phishing
- **False Negatives**: Phishing URLs missed by the system
